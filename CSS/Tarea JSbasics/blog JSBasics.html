                    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers
                    to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of the environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                    <ul>
                        <li><a class="links" href=""> Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for -Storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. JavaScript variables must
                            be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span> </li>
                        <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
                            <span>var x 10;</span> </li>
                        <li><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are as :important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need. to know the data type. There are six data vres that are JavaScript primitives: Hoolean - true or false; rain - null aka
                            nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, "Dojol ; and Object - <span>{first name: 'Jane', last_name: "Doc'}</span> </li>
                        <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements
                            in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else</span> if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition
                            is false;<span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                        <li><a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every program:Wig language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Ima.gine you have to run a mile, well you
                            run around the track four times and then you stop. 'Thats a loop! </li>
                        <li><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea,
                            we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call
                            our function over and over and over again.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
